# Aeronautical-viability-checker
This software aims to remove the need for real-world experimentation when assessing the aeronautical viability of design-stage aircraft. In part, this software aims to find the lift and drag forces by estimating the lift and drag coefficients without prior knowledge of them from windtunnel experiments.
